# TraceRoute-C-
Custom TraceRoute in C#

This is a tool which I made because I don't like the usual TraceRoute on Windows Terminal. 
I would like to set its features like latency and hops...
I made this one in less than one hour using C# which is easier than C++. 
I played with colors and a custom console so as to get a clean reading.
Can be modified easily ++
